# **AI E-Commerce Support Assistant — Project Requirement Document (PRD)**

---

## 🏷️ **Basic Details**

**Project Name:** AI E-Commerce Support Assistant

**Owner:** Akshay Bhardwaj

**Version:** v1.0

**Date:** 2024

---

## 🎯 **1. Overview**

> The AI-powered dashboard that helps Shopify store owners handle customer support automatically using AI.

**Product Pitch:** An intelligent customer support automation platform that reads support emails, maps them to Shopify orders, and suggests AI-powered responses with actionable insights. Reduce response time by 60%+ and improve customer satisfaction with automated, context-aware support.

**Why This Matters:** E-commerce store owners spend hours daily responding to repetitive support emails. This platform automates the entire workflow—from email ingestion to order matching to AI-suggested replies—freeing up time for strategic work while ensuring customers get faster, more accurate responses.

---

## 🧩 **2. Problem Statement**

- Store owners manually check support emails and Shopify orders.
- Responding to repetitive queries is time-consuming.
- Lack of automation → slower responses → unhappy customers.
  ✅ Goal: Use AI + Shopify + Mail integration to automate these workflows.
